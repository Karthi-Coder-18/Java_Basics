// The key to a loop is the conditional test. In Java, a conditional test is an
// expression that results in a boolean valueâ€”in other words, something that is
// either true or false.

// The result of a conditional test must be boolean!!

// The boolean test must be inside the parentheses of the loop

// As long as some condition is true, you do everything inside the loop block.
// The loop block is bounded by a pair of curly braces, so whatever you want to
// repeat needs to be inside that block.

// use comparison operations like >, <, == to run the boolean tests for the
// loops

// The print - prints the comment or the string value in the same line

// Println: Prints the comment or a string value in a new line !!

// There is not much difference between the [ if condition & while loop ]
// instead of saying while there is some condition , we say if there is some
// condition.
