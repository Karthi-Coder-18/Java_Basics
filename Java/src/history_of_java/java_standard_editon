In any programming language the specifications is like a Blueprint of the language of what need to be done. And the functionality part is the implementation of that blueprint.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/

1. Java Language Specifications (JLS) -> Defines the Syntax and rules of Java programming
2. Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS)
3. Java API Specification

-> oracle JDK, Oracle Open JDK , AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, Red Hat's open JDK are some of the platforms which are used to implement the above specifications.

-> We need a JDK to write, compile and execute JAVA programs.



JDK [JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT]

1. JDK contains Development tools like Compiler
2. JVM & JAVA API are also included inside the JDK as they both combinely called as JRE which is JAVA RUN TIME ENVIRONMENT.
3. Oracle used to provide JRE separately as a package till JAVA SE 10, but they have discontinued it from Java 11.

Open JDK includes the JAVA API library which is the java predefined code & also the JVM implementation called HOTSPOT (C++)
