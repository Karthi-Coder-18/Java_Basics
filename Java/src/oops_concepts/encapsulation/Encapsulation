ENCAPSULATION :






GETTERS (ACCESSORS) : Getter method is supposed to return a value whenever it is being called.

SETTERS (MUTATORS)  : Setter method is supposed to set the value which has been provided to it as an Argument and assign that value to the instance/reference variable of the class.



## We can't let an object of a class directly access the instance variables & change it's values. That is the reason we are using Setter methods and forcing the objects to call that method to set the value.


HIDING THE DATA IN ENCAPSULATION

1. Mark all your Instance variables using PRIVATE access modifier.

2. Mark all the Getters and Setters using PUBLIC access modifier.



## The usage of these getter & setter methods is to provide the accessibility to change the value or get the value from the class where the variables are present without distributing the complete code.



## When we declare an instance variables inside a class and don't initialize them & then try to call those variables using the class object then it will return the default value of the variable.

1. Number Primitives ( including CHAR ) has a default value as 0

2. For BOOLEAN it will be "FALSE"

3. For OBJECTS it will be "NULL"
