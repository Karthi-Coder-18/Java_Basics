Java Garbage Collection :

1. Each time an object is created in Java it gets stored in Heap also called as Garbage Collection Heap !!

2. when we create an object java allocates the required memory for that object based on the requirement. Once the if JVM finds that we are running on the low memory , it check for the objects which are not being used.

3. If an object is not used it is eligible for Garbage collection. Garbage Collector will run, throw out the unreachable objects, and free up the space so that the space can be reused.



Difference between Object and a class

# A class is an blueprint of an object

# It tells the JVM how to make an object of that class type. Each object created from that respective class will have it's own values for the variables of the class.

# THINGS that an object knows about itself is called as INSTANCE VARIABLES [ STATE of an object ]

# THINGS that an object can do is called as METHODS [ BEHAVIOUR of an Object ]

# A class can EXTEND another class and use all the variables & Override the methods inside it.

# SUPER CLASS : Which have the required variables and the Methods

# SUB CLASS : Which inherits all the attributes for the SUPER or PARENT class.

# At run time a Java program is nothing but objects talking to one another.
