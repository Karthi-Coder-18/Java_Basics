# JAVA COMPILE TIME : When the programmer write the code the javac compiler compiles / Converts that human readable formatted code into BYTE Format inorder to make JVM understand that.


# JAVA RUN TIME : JVM takes the BYTE code provided by javac and then run the complete code written by programmer.


# While creating an object we can use [Reference of an Interface and Object of the class]


# Instead of creating a seperate class to implement an Functional Interface, while creating an Object create an Anonymous class and Override the method inside the interface.
