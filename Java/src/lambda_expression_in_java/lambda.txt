-> Lambda expression works only with Functional Interface in java. 

-> Functional Interface is also called as SAM [Single Abstract Method]

-> An interface can be labelled as functional interface only if it has one METHOD inside the interface. 
  
-> In order to access the method and override it no need of create seperate class, instead use anonymous inner class or Lambda Expression ->  
   
-> In the above code when creating an object we use [ NEW Constructor method] & then method overriding. As we already know the code that needs to be written out there we avoid writing it as the compiler too knows it. 
    
-> Use Lambda expression here -> to avoid the extra code to be written. 
    
-> If there is only one line of code inside the method then we can remove the brackets as well.
