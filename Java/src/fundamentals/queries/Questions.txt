1. Check about the Implicit and Explicit casting in Java ?

Implicit Casting : When we pass a value to a method as an argument then Java will promote the SMALLER DATA TYPES to LARGER DATA TYPES automatically.

ex :
void myMethod(int x) {
    // Method code
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    byte myByte = 10;
    short myShort = 20;

    myMethod(myByte);  // Implicit promotion of myByte to int. Here Even if we pass an byte as an data type java is implicitly promoting the Byte to int data type.
    myMethod(myShort); // Implicit promotion of myShort to int
}



Explicit Casting : When we want to cast an LARGER DATA TYPE to SMALLER DATA TYPE then it be do using "Type Casting" concept.

Ex:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 123.456;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Explicit casting to int (results in 123, fractional part is discarded).

    //Syntax : data type | reference variable  = (data type which we want convert ) the actual variable whose datatype needs to be changed
}




2. Equals Operator in Java ?


## The ( == ) operator is used in Java to compare TWO VARIABLES of any kind & the operator simply compares bits of those variables.

## To check if two reference variables are same i.e. ( referring to same Object in the heap ) use the == operator. The == operator returns true if both the reference variables refer to same OBJECT.


## Use the .equals method to compare if two different Objects are equal or not ? [ check an example ]





What are the main differences between ABSTRACT CLASSES & INTERFACES? 

1. Methods inside the INTERFACES & ABSTRACT CLASSES can use which access modifiers? 
2. Is it allowed to declare VARIABLES inside INTERFACES or ABSTRACT CLASSES? 
3. What is the main difference between INTERFACES & ABSTRACT CLASSES? 
4. What are the access modifiers used for INTERFACES & ABSTRACT CLASSES in java? [ without inclusion of public & default]
