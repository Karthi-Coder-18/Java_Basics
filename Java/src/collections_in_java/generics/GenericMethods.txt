public <F> void raceWorld(F f){}

-> While creating an Generic method no matter if we are returning any value or not we need to provide the Diamond operator <> with an Generic type. 

-> Use the same letter in Parameters as well. The letter should be of Capitals. 

public <T,K> Integer scores(T t, K k){}

-> If we are using two parameters then the generic type letter must be used for them too, it should not be changed even if there is any return type. 

-> The Daimond operator should always be part of Method signature. 

public class Cricket <T>; 

Cricket <Integer> c = new Cricket<>(); // providing the generic typr value inside diamond operator while creating an object. 

-> Same applies for Class signature too
