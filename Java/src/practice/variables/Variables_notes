1. When a variable is created in java keep in mind that the below 3 are the main prerequisites which are required for the variable to work.

i. Variable TYPE
ii.Variable Name
iii. SIZE [ which is already fixed ]


2. Variables are like containers which can store some values based on the type assigned to it.

3. There are two different types of variables in Java

i. Primitive Type
ii. Instance type or Reference type



PRIMITIVE TYPE VARIABLES

1. There are total of 8 primitive type variables

boolean[ t / f ]
char [ 16bits ]
byte [ 8bits ]
short[ 16bits ]
int[ 32bits ]
long[ 64 bits ]

Floating type

float [ 32bits ]
double[ 64bits ]


2. We are not allowed to assign the bigger size variable type to smaller size type. it kind of not fits !!


LOCAL VARIABLE : These are the variables which are declared inside an Method. When we declare a local variables inside a method then at any cost it needs to be initialized or compiler throws an error.

INSTANCE VARIABLE : These are the variables which are defined inside an class, but outside an method and also used by an object of the class where it is defined.

STATIC VARIABLE : These variables are declared inside an class and can be used globally without any restrictions !!

REFERENCE VARIABLE : When an object is created to access an particular class we use an name for that object that is called as Reference variable.

METHOD PARAMETERS : The method parameters can also be considered as LOCAL variables.
